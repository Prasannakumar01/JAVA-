help from others .

Java can be edited in the notepad and notepad++ for the starters. Reason for the notepad is we can know the 
mistakes where we are commiting and learn from the mistakes that are done. 
 
If we use the editor like IDE we dont know where we are commiting the mistake with the advanced versions we are
able to get rectified by the predefined methods availble on the IDE.


With the instalation of jdk we can get the jre . It is a combo offer while we download it .


JRE is responsible to compile the program and it will help us to know the errors with the puntuations ,if there 
are any errors that we commit while coding they will be shown during the compilation 

jre is responsible to convert the human understandable language to system understandable language.

after compilation we can get the class file for the java file . with the help of that class file we can execute in 
any platform.


Jit is responsible to execute the code line by line.JIT-just in time.
